# Concept 
in australia, we have a lot of shonky sites that are dealing with electrical certs, lighting logs and they are just written, no proof someone has signed them....

lets fix that with blockchain, store data with someone signing a bundle or one item.



we push the pass ones into a checker to ensure if they used 90 minutes to test or not.

for quick ptb calling when creating a new em list
```bash
\"school\" \"location\" \"em_ID_1\" 90 true
```

object ID = 



testing: 
paypool: 
storage: 
package: 


coin: 

add format for testing: \"school\" \"location\" \"em\" 90 true
